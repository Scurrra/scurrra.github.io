				Hi, I'm Ilja Baro≈≠ski, Master of Mathematics and Computer
				Science. In 2023, I graduated from the Faculty of Mechanics and
				Mathematics of the Belarusian State University as Bachelor of
				Mathematics and System Analyses. In 2025, I got Master's degree
				in Mathematics and Computer Science.
			</p>

			<p>
				I have experience with C/C++, Rust, Python, Julia, C#, Dart,
				Wolfram, Go and Crystal. During my programming journey I try to
				make things better, optimize algorithm and create tools from
				scratch. It can be proved by projects listed on the <a
					href="/pets"><quote>projects</quote></a
				> page.

				My master's thesis was on computer modeling of human voice. The
				idea was to use wavelet theory to simplify model and make it
				really lightweight. During this work the <a

					>waveletnn</a
				> (Wavelet Neural Networks &mdash; wavelet transforms in PyTorch
				models) and <a href="https://github.com/Scurrra/ubpe">ubpe</a> (Universal
				Byte-Pair Encoding) libraries were developed.
