  "description": "UBPE is a Universal Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer designed for general sequences, including quantized signals and text. Unlike traditional BPE tokenizers, which focus primarily on text, UBPE supports custom alphabets and large token spaces, making it ideal for compressing 1D signals, time-series data, or multilingual text. The library provides an optimized classic BPE implementation for general sequences, as well as a novel approach that generates multiple encoding variants for a single sequence, allowing users to select the best representation based on TF-IDF scores. UBPE also includes Python-native and Cython (C++20) backends for high performance, making it suitable for both research and production use.",
