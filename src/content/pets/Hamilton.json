  "description": "Hamilton.cr is a lightweight Crystal framework for building Telegram bots, designed to simplify the development of interactive and high-performance bots. It supports handling commands, text messages, and rich media payloads (stickers, videos, GIFs, etc.), while offering built-in features like context storage for stateful conversations, asynchronous processing for scalability, and signal-based task control for managing long-running operations. The framework minimizes boilerplate and is easily extensible with custom handlers, making it ideal for both simple and complex bot applications.",
