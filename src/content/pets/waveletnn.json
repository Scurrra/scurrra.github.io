  "description": "A PyTorch-based library for integrating wavelet transforms into neural networks. The library enables seamless integration of wavelet-based feature extraction and processing within deep learning pipelines, supporting both 1D and 2D wavelet transforms for applications like signal processing, image analysis, and time-series data augmentation. By leveraging PyTorch’s autograd system, WaveletNN-PyTorch allows for end-to-end training of wavelet-augmented neural networks, combining the strengths of wavelet analysis with modern deep learning techniques.",
