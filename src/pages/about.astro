				Hi, I'm Ilja Baro≈≠ski, Master of Mathematics and Computer
				Science. In 2023, I graduated from the Faculty of Mechanics and
				Mathematics of the Belarusian State University as Bachelor of
				Mathematics and System Analyses. In 2025, I got Master's degree
				in Mathematics and Computer Science.
			</p>

				I have experience with C/C++, Rust, Python, Julia, C#, Dart,
				Wolfram, Go and Crystal. During my programming journey I try to
				make things better, optimize algorithm and crete tools from
				scratch. It can be proved by projects like
				<a href="https://github.com/Scurrra/cregex">cregex</a> &mdash; a
				tool for matching regexes in pure C,
				<a href="https://github.com/Scurrra/SimplePolynomialRing.jl"
					>SimplePolynomialRing.jl</a
				> &mdash; a Julia package for working with polynomial rings developed
				for course "Error detection and correction",
				<a href="https://github.com/Scurrra/docsync">docsync</a> &mdash;
				a cli tool for translation your documentation into another languages,
				<a href="https://github.com/Scurrra/fossil">Fossil.cr</a> &mdash;
				a simple framework for easier REST APIs development in Crystal,
				<a href="https://github.com/Scurrra/Corgi.jl">Corgi.jl</a> is an
				underdevelopment Julia package with machine learning algorithms from
				scratch.

				My masters thesis was on computer modeling of human voice.
				The idea was to use wavelet theory to simplify model and make it really lightweight.
				During this work the <a href="https://github.com/Scurrra/WaveletNN-PyTorch">waveletnn</a> library was developed.
				It provides trainable PyTorch's `nn.Module`s for using wavelet transform on both 1D signals and 2D images.
